              <h4>The Basics</h4>
              <p>Disc golf is a sport that combines elements of traditional golf with frisbee. The game is played on a course with a series of holes, each of which has a target, typically a metal basket or a designated area. The objective of the game is to throw a disc from a tee area and land it in the target in as few throws as possible.

                Players use a variety of discs, which come in different sizes and weights, to complete different types of throws, such as drives, approaches, and putts. Like golf, players keep score by counting the number of throws it takes to complete a hole, and the player with the lowest total score at the end of the round is the winner.
                
                Disc golf courses can vary widely in terms of layout, terrain, and difficulty, and can be found in parks, forests, and other natural areas around the world. The sport is popular among people of all ages and skill levels, and is enjoyed both recreationally and competitively.</p>

            <!--Equipment-->
            <div id="item-1-1">
              <h5>Equipment</h5>
              <p>To play disc golf, you will need a set of discs designed for the sport. These typically include a driver, a mid-range disc, and a putter, each with their own unique characteristics and uses. Discs come in a variety of materials, including plastic and rubber, and can be weighted and shaped differently to achieve different flight patterns. You may also want to invest in a disc golf bag to carry your discs around the course, as well as a towel to keep them clean and dry. Other optional equipment includes a scorecard and pencil to keep track of your score, and comfortable footwear for walking around the course. Overall, while there are a few essential pieces of equipment to play disc golf, the cost of getting started in the sport is relatively low compared to other activities, making it accessible to a wide range of people.</p>

            <!--Weather-->
            <div id="item-1-2">
              <h5>Weather</h5>
              <p>The ideal weather conditions for playing disc golf may vary depending on personal preferences and skill level. Generally, moderate temperatures with little to no wind are ideal for disc golf. Wind can greatly affect the flight path of discs, making it difficult to control throws and aim accurately. Additionally, rainy or wet conditions can make the course slippery and muddy, which can also affect footing and accuracy. Sunny and dry weather is preferable, as it allows for good visibility and a stable playing surface. However, it is important to take precautions to protect oneself from excessive heat or sun exposure, especially during peak summer months. Ultimately, the most important thing is to dress appropriately for the weather conditions and be prepared for any changes that may occur throughout the round.</p>

            <!--Teeing off-->
            <div id="item-2">
              <h4>Teeing off</h4>
              <p>To tee off in disc golf, start by selecting your desired disc and taking your position behind the tee pad, which is typically a rectangular area marked with a sign or painted lines. Determine your throwing style, such as backhand or forehand, and visualize your intended flight path. When you are ready, plant one foot on the tee pad and use your other foot to step forward and generate power for your throw. Swing your arm back in a smooth motion and release the disc towards the target. Follow through with your throw by extending your arm forward and shifting your weight towards the target. Remember to stay balanced and focused throughout your throw, and adjust your technique as necessary to achieve your desired outcome. With practice, you can develop your own unique throwing style and improve your accuracy and distance over time.</p>
            </div>
            <!--Forehand-->
            <div id="item-2-1">
              <h5>Forehand</h4>
              <p>A forehand throw, also known as a sidearm or flick, is one of the main throwing techniques in disc golf. To throw a forehand, start by gripping the disc with your fingers on the underside and your thumb on the top, similar to a handshake grip. Place your other hand on the edge of the disc for stability. Take a comfortable stance and position the disc to the side of your body, with your throwing arm extended towards the target. When you are ready to throw, swing your arm forward in a smooth motion, keeping your elbow close to your body and your wrist firm. Snap your wrist at the release point to impart spin on the disc and control its flight path. Follow through with your throw by extending your arm towards the target and shifting your weight forward. With practice and repetition, you can develop your forehand throw and use it to execute a variety of shots on the disc golf course.</p>
            </div>
            <!--Backhand-->
            <div id="item-2-2">
              <h5>Backhand</h5>
              <p>The backhand throw is the most common throwing technique in disc golf, and is characterized by a thrower pulling the disc back across their body and releasing it with a snap of the wrist. To throw a backhand, start by gripping the disc with your fingers on the underside and your thumb on top, similar to a frisbee throw. Place your other hand on the edge of the disc for stability. Take a comfortable stance, with your non-throwing shoulder facing the target. Bring the disc across your body, keeping it close to your chest, and shift your weight onto your back foot. As you begin to pull the disc forward, pivot on your back foot and transfer your weight forward onto your front foot. Release the disc with a snap of the wrist, using your fingers to create spin and control the flight path of the disc. Follow through with your throw by extending your arm towards the target and shifting your weight forward. With practice and repetition, you can refine your backhand technique and use it to execute a variety of shots on the disc golf course.</p>
            </div>
            <!--MidRange-->
            <div id="item-3">
              <h5>Mid-range</h5>
              <p>To have the best mid-range throw in disc golf, there are a few key techniques to keep in mind. First, select a mid-range disc that you feel comfortable throwing, and choose a grip that allows for a firm and secure hold on the disc. Next, take a comfortable stance with your feet shoulder-width apart and your non-throwing shoulder facing the target. As you begin your throw, bring the disc back across your body, keeping it close to your chest, and shift your weight onto your back foot. As you pivot on your back foot and transfer your weight forward onto your front foot, pull the disc forward and release it with a snap of the wrist. Focus on creating a smooth and consistent motion, and keep your eyes on the target throughout the throw. Adjust the angle and speed of your throw as needed to achieve your desired flight path. Practice your mid-range throws regularly to build consistency and accuracy, and experiment with different discs and grips to find what works best for you.</p>

            <!--Putting-->
            <div id="item-4">
                <h4>Putting</h4>
                <p>Putting in disc golf involves getting the disc into the basket from a short distance away. Here are some steps to help you putt successfully:

                    Choose the right disc: Select a putter that you feel comfortable throwing, and that has the right characteristics for your style and the conditions you are playing in.
                    
                    Take your stance: Stand behind the lie, which is a designated area behind the basket where you must release your putt from. Take a comfortable stance with your feet shoulder-width apart, and face the basket.
                    
                    Line up your shot: Align your body and your disc with the center of the basket, and visualize your intended flight path.
                    
                    Execute your putt: Using a smooth and consistent motion, bring the disc forward and release it with a gentle flick of the wrist. Focus on getting the disc into the center of the basket, rather than throwing it too hard or too high.
                    
                    Follow through: After releasing the disc, keep your arm extended towards the basket and maintain your stance until the disc comes to rest in the basket.
                    
                    Practice regularly: Putting is a crucial part of disc golf, so practice regularly to build consistency and confidence in your technique.
                    
                    By following these steps and practicing regularly, you can improve your putting in disc golf and shave strokes off your score.</p>
